"""Sync guard for the vendored ss_publish package.

ss-publish is vendored into multiple SovereignSignal repos (modelbytes,
clawbytes) as an identical ss_publish/ directory, with the canonical source at
repos/ss-publish/. Vendoring was chosen over a separate repo (2026-06-19) for
two slow-changing consumers; the cost is drift risk. This test catches it:
if anyone edits ss_publish/ in one repo without propagating to the others,
this test fails and names the file that drifted.

The canonical copy lives at ../ss-publish/ss_publish/ when the brain repos/
tree is checked out alongside this repo. When that sibling isn't present
(e.g. Railway build, fresh clone of just this repo), the test self-skips —
the per-repo unit tests (test_ss_publish_*) still cover the vendored code in
isolation.
